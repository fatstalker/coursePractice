//Second goal:function that plays a single round of the game. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection
    //and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
//Additional notes:
    //Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation),Account for TIES by re-playing the round.
