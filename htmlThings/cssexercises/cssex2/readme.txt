not so good. I used ids where I should have used multi class. 
also used type selector (p) instead of creating a class. this is not so much of a problem since I knew it would have been the same.
solution here "https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/blob/main/foundations/02-class-id-selectors/solution/solution.html"

edit: the day after I did it correctly recalling the solution methods.
